# Project Name: Android App Development

## Overview:
This project aims to develop a social media application for Android devices using Java for the Android version. The application will allow users to register, log in, view a feed of posts, interact with posts (like, share, comment), and manage their profiles. The app allows users to mimic basic features of the Facebook social media platform. In this part we integrated mongoDB and allowed the project to function with a working server written on node.js.

The branch PART 3 was made specifically to store this part of the project.

## Features:
- User authentication (register, log in, log out)
- Feed screen displaying posts with like, share, and comment functionality
- Profile management (view/edit profile information, upload profile picture)
- Dark mode/light mode toggle for UI customization
- Offline support with local storage synchronization
